ant farm project in 42 curriculum

It is a typical 42 C project where the goal is to write code with no more than 25 lines per function and 5 declarations per function. While the goal of these rules is clear, the implications are not justified. For me, at this point of time, the code is very unreadable with those limitations, especially in this project.

Beware everyone who would like to try and read it.
